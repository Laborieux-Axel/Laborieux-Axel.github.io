I am a currently a postdoc researcher at the [Friedrich Miescher Institute](https://fmi.ch) in Basel üá®üá≠ in computational neuroscience and AI in the team of [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org).
Prior to that, I completed my PhD in physics with [Damien Querlioz](https://sites.google.com/site/damienquerlioz/) at the [Center for Nanoscience](https://www.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) in Saclay üá´üá∑.
I am interested in how artificial and biological neural networks learn efficiently and how circuit structure relates to computation.
I am grateful to be funded by the [Swiss National Science Fundation](https://www.snf.ch/en).
You can find my CV <a href="/files/cv.pdf">here</a>.
