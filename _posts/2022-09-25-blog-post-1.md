Welcome to my new blog! I finally transitioned my old static website to a better one using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I will mainly blog about science I find interesting at the intersection of AI, neuroscience ðŸ§ , physics and [neuromorphic computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering) ðŸ¤–. Stay tuned!
