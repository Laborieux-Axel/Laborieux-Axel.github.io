                      The main contribution of this work done in collaboration with the <a href="https://mila.quebec">MILA</a> 
                      is the identification of a bias in the gradient estimate of EqProp which makes the training of deeper architectures unstable.
                      We propose a symmetric estimate that mostly cancels the bias and benchmark the performance on CIFAR10 against Backprop Through Time.

                    <p>You give a hundred reasons why, and you say you're really gonna try. Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that. Calling out my name. ‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything.</p>
                    <pre><code>Example code block</code></pre>
                    <p>Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am ready for the road less traveled. Already <a href="#">brushing off the dust</a>. Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Uh, She’s a beast. I call her Karma (come back). Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band. I can't sleep let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back.</p>

                    <p>I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating. Oh oh! Wanna be a victim ready for abduction. She's got that international smile, oh yeah, she's got that one international smile. Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your popsicle.</p>
                    <p>This is transcendental, on another level, boy, you're my lucky star.</p>

                    <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
                    <p>You got the finest architecture. Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. Never planned that one day I'd be losing you. She eats your heart out.</p>

                      <li>Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets.</li>

                    <ol>
                      <li>Scared to rock the boat and make a mess.</li>
                      <li>I could have rewrite your addiction.</li>
                      <li>I know you get me so I let my walls come down.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>After a hurricane comes a rainbow.</p>

                    <p>From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. Yeah, you take me to utopia. I'm walking on air. We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your popsicle. Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>I hope you got a healthy appetite.</li>
                      <li>You're never gonna be unsatisfied.</li>

                    <p>Don't need apologies. Boy, you're an alien your touch so foreign, it's <em>supernatural</em>, extraterrestrial. Talk about our future like we had a clue. I can feel a phoenix inside of me.</p>
