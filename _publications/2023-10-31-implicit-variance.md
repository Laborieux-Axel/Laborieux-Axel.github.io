title: "Implicit variance regularization in non-contrastive SSL"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2023-10-31-implicit-variance
excerpt: 'Non contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn by making representations invariant to random augmentations of data. However, how the trivial constant output solution (collapse) is avoided remains poorly understood. Building prior theories, we show how non-contrastive SSL might implicitly regularize the variance of learned representation, thereby avoiding collapse. Our theory also suggests new loss functions making learning more robust.'
